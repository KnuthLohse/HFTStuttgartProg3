Configurations that are not in tree form may cause an infinite loop
example:
[a:b]
[b:a]
Probably not realy of interrest because of the next Issue

Double definition of an ConfigurationObject is not catched and will cause undefined errors because the second object will not be written to the map.

Double use of same ServiceProcessor may cause problems and is not catched

Whitespaces in the Configfile might cause some problems cause they are considered as part of the names. Whitespacelines are not a problem
